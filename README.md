# void-number-counts
Investigating whether evidence for a void exists from the density distribution of astrophysical objects

Currently comparing methods of dealing with luminosity function
- numerical integration of a truncated Schechter function to allow $\alpha > 1$
- non-parametric luminosity function, inferred independently from density function
- 2d non-parametric grid, jointly describing luminosity and density distributions
